## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to use JavaScript in a way that would make the result of someone rating the service unique depending on their rating. 
I also learned that it is a bit more complicated than I thought (for me especially since I am not very familiar with JavaScript 
and started learning it not that long ago). 

### Continued development

I am continuing learning JS and getting more comfortable with it. I am planning to practice CSS and HTML more and also learning more
about WordPress.

## Acknowledgments

I used the Internet for some things and also looked at Sinka László's code to understand how to use JS so that rating would be possible.
